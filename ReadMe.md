# Library
## _The Onile Library_


Library is a project to study and a way to show my knowledge with react.ts and some libs.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) - Move faster with intuitive React UI tools
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/ptbr/docs/intro) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) - Build forms in React, without the tears
- [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) - Yup is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
- [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress
- [Json-Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) -Get a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds (seriously)
- [Date-Fns](https://date-fns.org/) -Provides the most comprehensive, yet simple and consistent toolset for manipulating JavaScript dates in a browser & Node.js.

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies

```sh
npm i
```

Start the server

```sh
npm run dev
npm run json
```

## How to use

After installing the dependencies and starting the servers, just access the address that appears in your terminal (usually [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/))
The site has a protection system so that users who are not logged in do not have access to pages other than the [Login](http://localhost:5173/login) page, so you will be immediately redirected to it, the user and password are:
- email: admin@admin.com.br
- password: admin123

Both can be changed directly by the db.json file

Once logged in, you have access to all pages on the site and can change and add new books.
